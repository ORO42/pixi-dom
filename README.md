# About

Experimenting with anchoring DOM elements relative to a pannable PixiJs canvas area.

# Controlls

Hold Spacebar then click and drag inside the canvas area to pan.

# Install/Run

1. `cd pixi-dom`
2. `npm i`
3. Run using VSCode Live Server extension, or your preferred method.

# Next Steps

- [ ] Constrain nodes within canvas bounds, so they can't be placed outside the canvas
- [ ] Prevent nodes from resizing at edge of viewport
- [ ] More extensive node & system behavior config options
- [ ] Node lifecycle events
- [ ] Smarter/configurable drag trigger behavior
- Connectors
  - [ ] Establish logical connections between nodes
  - [ ] Dynamically update positions of connector terminals to track nodes
